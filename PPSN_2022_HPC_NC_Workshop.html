 <h4>Abstract:</h4>
 
 <p>Natural Computing is ideal for High-Performance Computing
 workloads, mainly because of the inherent parallelism.
 Traditionally, natural computing methods have been designed for
 CPU-based machines. With the decline in Mooreâ€™s law, there is
 an increasing interest and need to port the CPU-based
 algorithms to GPUs and other high-performance platforms. The
 porting of these algorithms is not a mere software-engineering
 activity. The porting involves several modifications to the
 original algorithm. This workshop aims to bring awareness on
 the importance of this topic, and help bridge the gap between
  systems and algorithms groups.</p>
